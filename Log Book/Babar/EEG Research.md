## Different types of EEG Electordes
From my understanding there are 2 types of EEG Electrodes:
1. Surface Electrodes
2. Intracranial Electrodes
As it sounds, Surface Electrodes are placed on the surface of the head and Intracranial Electrodes are placed inside the brain.

## Different types of EEG Electrode Gels
From my understanding there are many different types of EEG Electrode Gels. The most common ones are warter based gels, saline based gels, and conductive gels. The difference between them is the amount of water and salt they contain. Warter based gels are more water based and saline based gels are more salt based. Conductive gels are a mix of both water and salt. They are used to make the surface of the head conductive to the electrical signals from the brain.

### Why are EEG Electorde Gels important?
EEG Electrode Gels are important because they make the surface of the head conductive to the electrical signals from the brain. Without them, the electrical signals would not be able to pass through the skin and into the brain. This would make it impossible to record EEG data. It is important to note the more salt used the better the conductivity of the gel, however, too much salt can cause the gel to dry out and become less effective, therefore it is important to find one with a suitable balance. 

### Is it possible to use EEG electrodes without a gel?
Theoretically, yes. However, the gel enhanced the connection between skin and the elctordes leadting to more accurate readings. 

### EEG Gel Safety Concerns
- EEG Gel is safe to use, however, it is important to note that it is not suitable for people with certain skin conditions such as eczema. It is also important to note that the gel should not be used on broken skin or wounds.
- Additioanlly, there is a chance of an allergic reaction occuring or the gel can cause irritation to the skin. It is important to test the gel on a small area of the skin before use to ensure that there is no reaction.
- To remove gel from the skin, it is important to use a mild soap and water, and not to rub the skin too hard.

## EEG Electrode Placement
The electrodes are placed on the head in specific regions of the brain to achieve the best results. Thre are 3 areas we will need to focus on are: 
1. [Mastoid](https://www.kenhub.com/thumbor/vAPVZGSbNDs-FMeDAkdUHPLNHks=/fit-in/413x413/filters:fill(FFFFFF,true):watermark(/images/watermark_only_413.png,0,0,0):watermark(/images/logo_url_sm.png,-10,-10,0):format(jpeg)/images/anatomy_term/processus-mastoideus/i69qkAHvcUSvEuXXQsZVTQ_Mastoid_process_01.png) Placed on the mastoid bone on the skull.
2. [Nasion](https://neupsykey.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/310119_2_En_10_Fig6_HTML.png) Placed 1 inch diagoanlly to the right of the nasion
3. [Inion](https://o.quizlet.com/uPBs3.vjcebG.YEiMt-TYw.jpg) Placed 1 inch diagoanlly to the right of the Inion

Using [This](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/70/21_electrodes_of_International_10-20_system_for_EEG.svg) the electrodes should be placed on Fp2 and O2
